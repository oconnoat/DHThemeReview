        <h1>The Unbearable Lightness of <br />Computer Science Research</h1> 
        <blockquote>Computer science... differs from physics in that it is not actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering; it is all about getting something to do something, rather than just dealing with abstractions, as in the pre-Smith geology.</blockquote>&mdash;<strong>Richard Feynman</strong>, Feynman Lectures on Computation, 1970

            <!--speaker notes-->
            <p>The realisation that we need to apply the computer to a problem is a key difficulty. The computer scientist has, to a varying degree, some interesting theory about how an algorithm might work or be improved. How do we show this? Some domains have constructed for themselves cathedrals of evaluation, and chase metrics. Others have broken out into application, and sought relevance from authentic users and real-world data. The problem with the former is that it's synthetic: often it fails in the real world, the problem of the latter is that it's too easy to approach it arrogantly: to believe you already know what technical panacaea to prescribe to the patient. Engineers have to give up some control to gain relevance.</p>
