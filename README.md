#DH Theme Review Talk
Five-seven minutes on who I am and how I got here.

1. Merkwurdigeliebe or, How I learned to stop worrying and love the User
    1. (Brief description of who I am from a CV perspective)
2. The Unbearable Lightness of CS Research
    1. authenticity and evaluation
    2. engineering vs. science vs. research
(Impact is hard)

3. Il n'y a pas de hors-code
    1. Teaching humanities students to think in code
    2. Understanding the semantic gap
    3. Summer Schools
(Learning to teach technology to non-technologists is a great way to discover the subtleties of what you're working with)

4. Lions and Tigers and Outputs! Oh My
    1. EU Projects: CENDARI, CULTURA
    2. Impact on ADAPT
    2. Supervision: Emma Clarke
    3. Other Collaborations: SELKIE, SPARKLE, ExploreAT!
    4. DARIAH and Other Networks: VCC1, COST actions
    5. Invited Talks: MLWeb, THATCamp
(DH has helped me begin to move from post-doc to PI,
directly through projects, but also by being a place to build reputation,
contacts and network, and to gain new ideas as well as validation of our own technology)

5. The Undiscovered Country (I wish this were hamlet, but it's really star trek)
    "I didn't know you could do that! I didn't know you wanted to!"
(Future projects include collaborations in networks, supervising more students, developing my profile in CS and in DH, and continuing to fix encoding errors)
